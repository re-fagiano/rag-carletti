# AGENTS Instructions

- Keep the main web interface in `static/index.html`. This file already contains inline CSS and must continue to show the RtoR logo (`static/logo_rtor.png`).
- Do not remove or rename `static/index.html` or `static/logo_rtor.png` unless explicitly instructed.
- Additional HTML files in `static/` (e.g. `index_responsive.html`, `index_mobile_redesign.html`) are optional and can be ignored.
- There are currently no automated tests; you may run manual checks or `python main.py` to ensure the interface loads.
